Knotty provides a transferable format for publishing and distributing
knitting patterns. Designs can be saved in an open source format that is
permanently in the public domain, and free tools are provided to convert
these files into other media including hand knitting instructions, graphical
knitting charts, and Knitspeak files.

Knitspeak files can also be loaded into Knotty, and graphical images
can be converted directly into colorwork patterns.

Single-color Knotty patterns can be converted to and from the Knitspeak
format used by @hyperlink{http://stitch-maps.com @literal{Stitch Maps}}.


@section[#:tag "xml"]{Saving and Loading Patterns}

Having defined the pattern @elem[#:style typewriter]{demo}, you can save it by
typing the following line into DrRacket:

@; NB whitespace indentation is required here
@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #f]|{
#lang sweet-exp typed/racket
save demo "demo.xml"

}|

The @elem[#:style typewriter]{.xml} suffix is conventional for files that use
the text-based format XML. Since this is a text file, you can load it into a
web browser or text editor and view the data directly.

The data format is defined in a separate file called a schema. The
@hyperlink{https://github.com/t0mpr1c3/knotty/blob/main/knotty-lib/resources/xml/knotty.xsd
 Knotty schema} will always be freely available. This means that you truly
own your Knotty patterns, and will always be able to use them without
restriction.

One useful thing that you can do with a Knotty XML file, not surprisingly,
is load it back into Knotty. When you recover the file, a new pattern is
created. Let's call the reloaded pattern @elem[#:style typewriter]{my-demo}:

@; NB whitespace indentation is required here
@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #f]|{
#lang sweet-exp typed/racket
define
  my-demo
  recover "demo.xml"

}|


@section[#:tag "knitspeak"]{Working with Stitch Maps}

@hyperlink{http://stitch-maps.com @literal{Stitch Maps}} is a fantastic website
for editing and viewing lace patterns. You can browse through thousands of
existing designs, each with a clever chart that closely resembles a real swatch.
You can create your own patterns in a user-friendly format called
@hyperlink{https://stitch-maps.com/about/knitspeak/ @literal{Knitspeak}},
which reads just like English-language knitting instructions. It takes just a
few minutes to get started, and  lot of work has been put into making everything
easy to use. I highly recommend taking a look, because it is honestly one of the
best knitting websites around.

The major limitation of patterns created in Knitspeak is that colorwork is not
possible. That's where Knotty comes in handy! You can import Knitspeak patterns
into Knotty using the @racket{import-ks} command, and add as many different yarns
as you like.

@racket{export-ks} converts a Knotty pattern into Knitspeak, so that you can
show off your design as one of Stitch Map's great-looking diagrams. Yarn
information is lost in the conversion. And since Knitspeak is geared towards hand
knitters, techniques associated with machine knitting are not available.

Although the vast majority of patterns on Stitch Maps can be loaded without any
changes, the Knotty flavor of Knitspeak is a little bit more restrictive in terms
of what is allowed. For example, Knotty insists that the entire workpiece must
either be knit flat, with RS and WS rows that alternate, or circular. This means
that short rows are not allowed in circular knitting. In contrast, Stitch Maps
allows RS and WS rows to be combined in any order. Also, line numbers in Knotty
must start at 1 and form a consecutive sequence, unlike Stitch Maps. Lastly,
Knotty does not implement some of the less common stitches such as threaded
stitches, wrapped stitches, and gathers.


@section[#:tag "png"]{Importing Graphics}

@racket[import-png] provides a simple interface to import PNG files. The default
settings produce a colorwork pattern for hand knitting.

@; NB whitespace indentation is required here
@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #f]|{
#lang sweet-exp typed/racket
show
  import-png "scribblings/danny.png"

}|

@section[#:tag "app"]{Knotty Application}

Another way to convert knitting patterns from one format to another is by using the
Knotty application, which is available for Windows and Linux operating systems and
can be downloaded from the @hyperlink{https://github.com/t0mpr1c3/knotty/releases
github repository}.

@subsection[#:tag "install"]{Installation}

To install the application, simply decompress the archive and move the resulting
folder to the desired filesystem location. The Windows executable is called
@elem[#:style typewriter]{knotty.exe}. The Linux executable is called
@elem[#:style typewriter]{knotty} and is located in the @racket[bin] subdirectory.

@subsection[#:tag "cli"]{Running the Application}

The application is run from the command line from within the
@elem[#:style typewriter]{Powershell} or @elem[#:style typewriter]{Command Prompt}
consoles in Windows, or the Linux @elem[#:style typewriter]{terminal}. Command line
arguments are used to specify the input and output formats. Information on these
and other parameters can be obtained using the @elem[#:style typewriter]{-h} or
@elem[#:style typewriter]{â•Œhelp} option.

Let's say you have downloaded the zip file onto a computer running Windows and
extracted the contents to @elem[#:style typewriter]{C:\Users\Tom\Documents\knotty-app}.
The archive will contain a folder called something like
@elem[#:style typewriter]{knotty-v0.1-win}. (The exact name will depend on which
version you have downloaded.) To view the help message, open a Powershell console
and type the following:

@; NB whitespace indentation is required here
@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #f]|{
#lang scribble/text
cd \Users\Tom\Documents\knotty-app\knotty-v0.1-win
.\knotty.exe -h
}|

If that works, try using the application to convert the example pattern
@elem[#:style typewriter]{lattice.xml} which you can find in the folder
@elem[#:style typewriter]{knotty-lib/resources/example} of the knotty
repository. (The pattern corresponds to the
@hyperlink{https://t0mpr1c3.github.io/knotty/example/index.html
knitting chart on this webpage.} Click
@hyperlink{https://t0mpr1c3.github.io/knotty/example/lattice.png
here} to see a swatch.)

You will need to select the import format -- in this case, option
@elem[#:style typewriter]{-x} for XML -- and one or more export formats. So, for
example, to convert the pattern into a webpage you will need to type something
like the text below. (The exact location will depend on where you cloned the
repository.)

@; NB whitespace indentation is required here
@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #f]|{
#lang scribble/text
.\knotty.exe -xH ..\..\knotty\knotty-lib\resources\example\lattice
}|

(Note that you don't need to supply the file extension for
@elem[#:style typewriter]{lattice.xml} because it is implied by the
@elem[#:style typewriter]{-x} option.)

Now if you look in the @elem[#:style typewriter]{example} folder you should see
a new file called @elem[#:style typewriter]{lattice.html}. You will also find
folders called @elem[#:style typewriter]{css}, @elem[#:style typewriter]{js}
and @elem[#:style typewriter]{icon} that contain the associated files. Open the
HTML file in a web browser to view the page.

By default, the application saves output files with the same filename stem as
the input file. The @elem[#:style typewriter]{-o} option allows other
filenames to be exported.


@section[#:tag "stylesheets"]{Publishing to Webpages}

One of the benefits of HTML output is that you can publish patterns immediately
on the internet. Another is that the dynamic qualities of HTML also make for an
interactive chart. Hover the mouse over a stitch symbol and the knitting
instructions appear. Use the slider to zoom in and out, and the scrollbars to
move the position of the chart. Click the heading marked "Instructions" and
written knitting pattern will appear.

If you are familiar with CSS, you can give the pages a personal touch by editing
the stylesheets that come with the web pages so that the colors, fonts, and layout
match your preferences.
